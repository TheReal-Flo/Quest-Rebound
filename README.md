# Quest: Rebound
## A modern keybinding helper for QuestCraft (and eventually Vivecraft)

Quest: Rebound aims to be a modern replacement for the outdated mod [Questbind](https://modrinth.com/mod/questbind), which was used before to change keybinds in QuestCraft.
Since QuestCraft changed to OpenXR a few months ago, Questbind became obsolete.

Since then, no other solution to this problem has been released, and because I got bored one night, I began developing one myself, and here it is :)

**WARNING:**

This mod is still in a very early stage, and I started developing it after being awake for 16 hours already. While developing the first build, I recognized quite a few performance problems on my Pico 4, which I haven't seen without the mod before. Just saying.
Be warned, the 1.0 alpha builds are only intended for testing purposes, and I will add support for more versions once I reach a beta stage with fixed performance and a UI

This mod will be deprecated once Vivecraft or QuestCraft provides a native solution. (probably QuestCraft 7.0 or 6.1)

## Features:
- [x] Rebinding of Vivecraft actions
- [x] Binding of Minecraft keybinds
- [x] UI for rebinding key
- [ ] Share configurations
- [x] Detect the correct controller layout in GUI (Not needed as we only need to provide one layout)
- [x] Implement QuestCraft support for Samsung Odyssey (also known as Galaxy XR)
